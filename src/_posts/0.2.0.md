A-Frame has come alive in the three months since its release. It has received an overwhelmingly positive response by putting the creation of immersive and VR web content into everyone's hands.

## By the Numbers

- The [A-Frame GitHub repo][github] has garnered over 1500 stars, 25 contributors, and 550 commits.
- The [A-Frame community Slack channel][slack] has over 450 people asking question, showing off projects, hanging out.
- The [awesome-aframe repo][awesome] has collected over 100 entries of awesome things people have built regarding A-Frame.

It has received even some high-profile production use:

- [Amnesty International UK][amnesty] in partnership with [Junior][junior] published [360 Syria][360syria], built using A-Frame. 360 Syria virtually transports people to Aleppo, Syria to feel the effects of the barrel bombs on the citizens of the besieged city.
- [The Washington Post] published [Mars: an Interactive Journey][mars], built using A-Frame. "Mars: an Interactive Journey" virtually transports people to the grounds of The Red Planet to learn about it and its space programs.

Since A-Frame has been released, team and the community have been kicking the tires on A-Frame, discovering its limitations. A-Frame embodies the [Extensible Web Manifesto][extensible], promoting short-term innovation and experiments through extending A-Frame's functionality with components. For the majority of this release, we have been hard at work improving its extensibility and making sure that anything is possible. To see the full list of changes in this release, check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md):

## Broad Strokes

The component API has been greatly enhanced with more lifecycle methods, schema configurations, and property types. We have been experimenting with building lots of components (e.g., [layout][layout], [physics][physics], [templating][template], [text][text]), finding out limitations in the core API, and removing the obstacles.

Primitives such as `<a-box>` or `<a-image>` have been refactored to become "first-class entities". The implementation previously involved using templating which we found was limiting and unpredictable. Now `<a-box>` is simply an aliased `<a-entity>` with preconfigured components that map HTML attributes to component properties. Ultimately, this means that we can now attach arbitrary components to primitives.

We have introduced extensibility of the material component with the ability to register custom shaders. Custom shaders can be used to either register a reusable custom [three.js][three] material, or to register reusable GLSL shaders (similar to [stack.gl][stack]) that can be configured from markup. We imagine this will democratize graphics and shader development, just as how A-Frame has democratized three.js development. A graphics wizard can share a modular shader, a web developer can grab that shader, drop it into their site, and configure its many parameters with simple HTML attributes.

A preliminary API for systems (of the entity-component-system pattern) has landed. Systems provide global scope and services for components (e.g., physics systems for all physics/rigid-body components, material system to assist in texture caching and global updates).

With `AFRAME.registerComponent`, `AFRAME.registerPrimitive`, `AFRAME.registerShader`, and `AFRAME.registerSystem`, A-Frame is committed on encouraging reusable and modular building blocks for the virtual reality web.
