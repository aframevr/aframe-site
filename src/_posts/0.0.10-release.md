### Today the MozVR team releases the first version of A-Frame: an open source framework for creating WebVR experiences with markup.

A-Frame makes it easy for web developers to create virtual reality experiences that work across desktop, mobile, and the Oculus Rift.

We created A-Frame because we wanted to make WebVR development easier. WebVR has shipped in builds of Firefox and Chromium since the summer of 2014, but creating content for it has required knowing WebGL. The WebGL community is unbelievably talented, and has created many mind-blowing VR experiences in the last year, but they are a small subset of the full web development community. There are millions of talented developers who do not know WebGL. What if each of them could create and share WebVR experiences?

A-Frame is designed to be familiar to those web developers. It wraps the power of WebGL in HTML custom elements, so creating a high performance VR experience is as simple as:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframevr.io/releases/latest/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-sky src="https://aframevr.github.io/aframe/examples/_skies/lake.jpg"></a-sky>
      <a-model src="https://aframevr.github.io/aframe/examples/showcase-composite/sculpture.dae" position="0 0 -2"></a-model>
      <a-image src="https://aframevr.github.io/aframe/examples/showcase-composite/portland.png" width="1" height="0.35" position="-2 1.2 1"></a-image>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

A-Frame ships with powerful and concise "primitives" for common use cases such as 360-degree videos, images, models, skies, and more. Primitives make it easy to block out a scene in minutes. Primitives can also be combined with lighting, animation, sound and interactivity. For the full list of primitives included in A-Frame 0.1.0, see the [A-Frame documentation](../../../../../docs/primitives).

For users who want deeper control and flexibility, A-Frame is built on an entity-component system which provides accessible components for lighting, materials, re-usable assets, and more. This pattern is common in the game development world, and is the backbone of A-Frame. Visit the [A-Frame documentation](../../../../../docs/core/) to learn more about the entity-component system.

A-Frame is ultimately just the DOM, so developers can also manipulate it with standard JavaScript methods, such as:

```js
var scene = document.querySelector('a-scene');
var cube = document.createElement('a-cube');
cube.setAttribute('color', 'red');
scene.appendChild(cube);
```

A-Frame is new. The 0.1.0 version has several known issues, and the API will change over the next few months as we get feedback and open source contributions. Our hope is that early adopters find it as fun as we do, and join us in improving A-Frame over time.

To get started with A-Frame, visit [aframe.io](https://aframe.io/), [view the examples](../../../../../examples/) and [grab the code](../../../../../docs/guide/). The [FAQ](../../../../../faq/) provides additional details.

To discuss A-Frame with our team and fellow developers, hop into the [A-Frame Slack channel](https://aframevr-slack.herokuapp.com/). Feedback is welcomed at [@aframevr](https://twitter.com/aframevr/). As are [bug reports](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/) and [pull requests](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/).
