### Today the MozVR team releases A-Frame: a new open source framework for creating WebVR experiences with simple markup.

A-Frame makes it easy for web developers to create responsive VR experiences that can be viewed on desktop, mobile, and the Oculus Rift.

WebVR has been shipping since mid-2014, and amazing content has been created for it, but it's largely been limited to the relatively small WebGL development community. There are millions of talented web developers who do not know WebGL. What if it was easy for them to create a VR site and share it with anyone on any device? We built A-Frame to throw a lit match into that dry field.

A-Frame is designed to be familiar for web developers. It is HTML. It wraps the power of WebGL in custom elements, so creating a high performance VR experience is as simple as:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframevr.io/releases/latest/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-sky src="https://aframevr.github.io/aframe/examples/_skies/lake.jpg"></a-sky>
      <a-model src="https://aframevr.github.io/aframe/examples/showcase-composite/sculpture.dae" position="0 0 -2"></a-model>
      <a-image src="https://aframevr.github.io/aframe/examples/showcase-composite/portland.png" width="1" height="0.35" position="-2 1.2 1"></a-image>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

Out of the box A-Frame provides powerful building blocks for models, videos, 3D objects, and more. By customizing these primitives and adding interactivity and animation, users can create an infinite number of 3D worlds, from 360° video tours to animated fly throughs to interactive models. Developers who want to dive deeper can tap into an extensive underlying component architecture for materials, lighting, and more. Or manipulate A-Frame with JavaScript, using standard methods like:

```js
var scene = document.querySelector('a-scene');
var cube = document.createElement('a-cube');
cube.setAttribute('color', 'red');
scene.appendChild(cube);
```

A-Frame was born as an internal tool of the Mozilla virtual reality team (MozVR), helping us to produce VR experiments faster and easier. In creating it we drew inspiration from both pre-existing declarative 3D solutions like [JanusVR](http://www.janusvr.com/), and from best practices in the web and game development industries. We envision A-Frame as filling a gap in the VR tooling market by providing:

* Compatibility with the modern web, on desktop, mobile, and the Oculus Rift.
* A smooth learning curve between beginner ease of use and expert power.
* Familiarity for web developers who don't know WebGL.
* The power and flexibility of an Entity-Component architecture.
* A vibrant open source community of shared knowledge and building blocks.

Our hope is that A-Frame helps to accelerate the growth of VR web experiences and developers. We look forward to rapidly evolving with the open source community. [Feedback, bug reports](), and pull requests are much appreciated!
