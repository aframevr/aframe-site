### Don't Worry It's Less Than 10 Lines of HTML

AR.js is an efficient Augmented Reality solution on the Web.  It runs 100% in
your web browser, this means no app to install!  There is no need for a
specific device either e.g. Tango or iphone.  It runs on all mobile platforms:
Android, iOS11 and Windows mobile.  You can use it with your own phone.

Depending on your device, it can run very fast, up to 60fps on 2year-old
phones!  On top of that, the code is open source and all available on
[github](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/ar.js).

A-Frame is very easy to use so I wanted to make sure that AR.js was working
well with it. Thus, combining A-Frame and AR.js, it's simple for everybody to
create AR content on the web.

Sounds good? Let's see how to use it.

## Show Don't Tell

[![screen shot 2017-07-05 at 14 40 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6317076/27867019-5c4699d4-6190-11e7-831b-e8251711acdf.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_Uj0C8sMi4&feature=youtu.be&utm_content=buffer22f18&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)

Today you can make [augmented reality in 10 Lines of
HTML](https://medium.com/arjs/augmented-reality-in-10-lines-of-html-4e193ea9fdbf),
isn't the web amazing? It is really that simple, you can try live on
[codepen](https://codepen.io/jeromeetienne/pen/mRqqzb). Just put a [hiro
marker](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/data/images/HIRO.jpg)
in front of the camera and we will add the augmented reality on it.

```html
<!-- include A-Frame obviously -->
<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.6.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
<!-- include ar.js for A-Frame -->
<script src="https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js"></script>
<body style='margin : 0px; overflow: hidden;'>
  <a-scene embedded arjs>
    <!-- create your content here. just a box for now -->
    <a-box position='0 0.5 0' material='opacity: 0.5;'></a-box>
    <!-- define a camera which will move according to the marker position -->
    <a-marker-camera preset='hiro'></a-marker-camera>
  </a-scene>
</body>
```

In this scene, the camera is being moved by AR.js, and
the origin of your scene is at the center of the marker.
All the rest is normal A-Frame.
So if you want to add new objects in the augmented reality, just add it
near the `<a-box>`

## Add Augmented Reality in your A-Frame Project
![screen shot 2017-07-05 at 14 22 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6317076/27867071-8833eaf6-6190-11e7-9fb9-9deac93b88bd.png)

To include AR.js, you need to include [aframe-ar.js](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js). Then you initialize ar.js in `<a-scene>`.

```html
<a-scene embedded arjs>
```

Then you tell A-Frame that you want arjs to control the camera. For that, you just add

```html
<a-marker-camera preset='hiro'></a-marker-camera>
```

Don't forget to add the body style and a-scene embedded attribute. And you are
**ALL DONE** ð

## Personalize Your AR Content

Now we have a basic cube in AR...  It would be good to personalise the AR a
bit. Let's see how to add a text, an image or even your own model in augmented
reality.

![screen shot 2017-07-05 at 14 45 35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6317076/27867143-bf05926e-6190-11e7-855f-a90ab71976fc.png)

One of the most asked questions has been "how to load my own model in AR?".  As
I said before, ar.js controls the displacement of the camera, all the rest is
classic A-Frame. So you can load a model exactly as you would in A-Frame.

Here is an example of loading a [gltf](https://www.khronos.org/gltf) model,
just add that in your a-scene.  For more detail see [A-Frame documentation
about models](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/introduction/models.html##sidebar).

```html
<!-- define your gltf asset -->
<a-assets>
  <a-asset-item id="tree" src="/path/to/tree.gltf"></a-asset-item>
</a-assets>
<!-- use your gltf model -->
<a-entity gltf-model="##tree"></a-entity>
```

Another way to easily personalize your AR is to put a text or an image on top.
To add a text, simply just use
[a-text](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/primitives/a-text.html) as below.

```html
<a-text value="Hello, World!"></a-text>
```

To add an image,
[a-image](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/primitives/a-image.html) is easy. Just
paste this in your A-Frame scene.

```html
<a-image src="another-image.png"></a-image>
```

## Customize Your Marker

![arjs marker training](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6317076/27867192-e55306b8-6190-11e7-9bd1-7a9dbf4fa76a.png)

We understand that many people want to personalize the marker. It is possible
to replace the Hiro pattern with your own image, as long as it is inside the
black border.  We have provided an easy way to this. It is called the [marker
generator](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html).
We even wrote a whole step by step
[post](https://medium.com/arjs/how-to-create-your-own-marker-44becbec1105) to
help you get started.

First, you upload your own image and generate a pattern file `pattern-marker.patt`.
Second, you download the trained marker. And third, potentially print your marker.
We provide a PDF file to make it easier for you.

What to do with the generated pattern file?  This file contains the encoded
marker that you should reuse in your code.  You specify you want a pattern
marker and you provide the url to your own marker.  So in our case
`<a-marker-camera>` should be replaced by the following.

```html
<a-marker-camera type='pattern' patternUrl='path/to/pattern-marker.patt'></a-marker-camera>
```

Simple enough.

## Different Type of Markers: Pattern and Barcode

Up to now, we use the 'pattern' marker. But AR.js supports another kind of
marker, called barcode. Each of those markers contains a kind of binary code
which encodes a number. For example below, you see one representing 5.

![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/252962/27870433-c18f6e10-619a-11e7-8479-4cb662798740.png)

Barcode markers may be very useful for various type of applications, especially
when you have many locations with various markers.  For example, [Marcel
Freinbichler](https://twitter.com/fr3ino) and [Lisi
Linhart](https://twitter.com/lisi_linhart) wanted to do a augmented reality
application for their school: *"When you go to a room, you point your phone and
it shows you in augmented reality the availability of this room."*

So they chosed to use barcode markers: one barcode per room. Thus when the AR
application sees the marker, it converts that to into a number which matches
the room. So you do a xmlhttprequest to get the current schedule of the room
and display it on top of the marker.

I love this idea! It is useful for other people in the school. It has nice
panash with AR. But most of all, it provides relevant informations directly
where and when needed. This is a key principle for AR applications.

## Add Barcode Marker in Your Project

To add them in your project is rather straight forward.
First you need to tell AR.js to start detecting them and their type of
binary code. So you modify a-scene as below.

```html
<a-scene arjs='detectionMode: mono_and_matrix; matrixCodeType: 3x3;'></a-scene>
```

Now that ar.js knows you want to use barcode markers, on each of your marker
you need to specify which number you will use, e.g. for barcode 5.

```html
<a-marker type='barcode' value='5'></a-marker>
```

Here is [barcode marker
generator](http://www.artoolworks.com/support/applications/marker/) to generate
your own. Up to you to use the [type of matrix
code](http://www.artoolworks.com/support/library/Using_2D-barcode_markers)
matches you need.  Sometimes such configurations may be painful so to simplify
common cases, we used preset.

## Markers Presets for Easier Configuration

To make it easier and to avoid repeating ourselves, it is possible to have
preset to configure your markers.  Currently there are 2 presets "hiro" and
"kanji"

```html
<!-- here is a hiro preset -->
<a-marker preset='hiro'></a-marker>
<!-- it is the same as the marker below -->
<a-marker type='pattern' url='http://examples.org/hiro.patt'></a-marker>

<!-- here is a kanji preset -->
<a-marker preset='kanji'></a-marker>
<!-- it is the same as the marker below -->
<a-marker type='pattern' url='http://examples.org/kanji.patt'></a-marker>
```

![screen shot 2017-07-05 at 14 50 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6317076/27867388-64baee98-6191-11e7-9fbe-586fd79eba9d.png)

## Move the Camera or the Marker?

When handling augmented reality, you need to decide if you want the
3d world origin to be the camera or the marker. Most people will use
the marker as origin because it is more intuitive. Let's see the details
of each mode.

In one mode, you use `<a-marker-camera>`. In this mode, the camera is
moving and the marker is static, fixed at 0,0,0.  This way to work is more
common for 3d programmers, so it is the one I use in most examples.

```html
<a-marker-camera preset='hiro'></a-marker-camera>
```

In the other mode, you use `<a-marker>`.  It behaves the other way around:
the camera is static at all times while the objects or markers are moving.  The
camera is fixed at 0,0,0 at all times and looks toward negative-z.
Nevertheless this mode got a limitation, it can't handle multiple independent
markers at once.  So if you have multiple markers and want to handle them
independently from each other e.g. like in [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIEZwmjuaUA&list=PL2oSKUSmuoTECUCvHDvifRhztkOYduQsq&index=10).

You will need to use `<a-marker>`, and a simple camera instead.


```html
<!-- define your markers -->
<a-marker preset='hiro'>
  <!-- here define the content to display on top of the marker -->
  <a-box position='0 0.5 0' material='color: red;'></a-box>
</a-marker>
<!-- define a simple camera -->
<a-entity camera></a-entity>
```

## How to Handle Multiple Distinct Markers

Now that we have seen various possibilities of
[AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/ar.js), let's end with a last example
of multiple distinct markers. Those can be useful in various applications e.g.
a 'measure it' like below.  So we will have 3 markers, one with a preset, one
with a custom pattern marker, and a barcode.

```html
<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.6.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js"></script>
<body style='margin : 0px; overflow: hidden;'>
  <a-scene embedded arjs='sourceType: webcam;'>
    <!-- handle marker with your own pattern -->
    <a-marker type='pattern' patternUrl='path/to/pattern-marker.patt'>
      <a-box position='0 0.5 0' material='color: red;'></a-box>
    </a-marker>

    <!-- handle marker with hiro preset -->
    <a-marker preset='hiro'>
      <a-box position='0 0.5 0' material='color: green;'></a-box>
    </a-marker>

    <!-- handle barcode marker -->
    <a-marker type='barcode' value='5'>
      <a-box position='0 0.5 0' material='color: blue;'></a-box>
    </a-marker>

    <!-- add a simple camera -->
    <a-entity camera></a-entity>
  </a-scene>
</body>
```
