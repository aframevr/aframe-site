Tracked controllers has landed! Use the HTC Vive controllers with A-Frame. NPR
has published a WebVR site, [@rondagdag](https://twitter.com/rondagdag) hooked
up A-Frame to control a robot with Leap Motion, and we now have an [initial
community code of conduct](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)!

0.3.0 is still in progress, and several members of the team will be out next
week. We need to land [improved embedded scene
support](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/pull/1474), fix the [resolution
quality regression on VR
mobile](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/1541), implement built-in
link traversal support, and [refresh the
homepage](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-site/tree/redesign). We may
publish an official beta build next week to hold folks over (depending on our
progress).
