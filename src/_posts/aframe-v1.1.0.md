**This week also marks A-Frame's fith birthday**. Five years ago, on December, 2015,
we released the first version of A-Frame to make it easier for anyone to build VR
experiences. What started as a little personal project it's today a community of hundreds of thousands of developers worldwide.

More than 40 A-Framers helped to get 1.1.0 across the finish line. 20 of those made their first contribution. We appreciate help from everybody and newcomers are always especially celebrated. A-Frame is only as strong as its community.

We also thank Google and Oculus WebXR teams. They made an outstanding effort in a tough year. They kept the Immersive Web standard moving forward with new APIs while delivering new implementations in Chrome and the Oculus browsers.

Read the [release notes and changelog](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/releases/tag/v1.1.0) to check all the new features and celebrate everyone that made it happen.
