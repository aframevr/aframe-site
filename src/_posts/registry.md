[A-Frame v0.4.0](/blog/aframe-v0.4.0/) introduced a curated list of components called [The Registry](https://aframe.io/aframe-registry/). [The inspector](https://aframe.io/aframe-inspector/example/) puts the whole collection at the tip of your fingers. Just type the name of a component to fetch it from the registry and apply it to any entity.
