[webvr1.0]: https://w3c.github.io/webvr/

A-Frame **version 0.3.0** has dropped! With support for the **[new WebVR 1.0
API][webvr1.0]**, we aim higher towards state-of-the-art VR. With room-scale
tracking, we can walk in a web page; and with tracked controller support, we
can reach out into the world.

## What's New?

**WebVR 1.0** support is the highlight of this release. This includes:

- Better **room-scale** support to be able to walk/dash/duck/jump in a web
  page with the HTC Vive.
- Hitting **90 frames per second** due to being able to push content directly to the headset
  display rather than mirroring a desktop display. This also allows us to have different
  content on the desktop display than the headset, opening the door for asynchronous gameplay
  and spectator modes.

As a corollary, A-Frame now supports **tracked controllers** with the HTC Vive.
Tracked controllers go hand-in-hand with room-scale. Grab an HTC Vive and the
[experimental WebVR-enabled Chromium build](https://webvr.info/get-chrome/)
(which currently supports the Vive) and try out the [basic hand controls
demo](https://aframe.io/aframe/examples/showcase/tracked-controls/) or [ball
throw](https://bryik.github.io/aframe-ball-throw/).

We are also releasing the much-anticipated **A-Frame Inspector** ([view
demo][inspectordemo]). The current primary purpose of the Inspector is to
serve as a complementary tool for inspecting and tweaking scenes alongside
code; it is more akin to your favorite browser's DOM Inspector rather than
an end-to-end tool such as Unity. The easiest way to try out the A-Frame
Inspector is to press `<ctrl> + <shift> + i` on any A-Frame scene using v0.3.0.

Other noteworthy changes include significant performance improvements,
improved support for multiple scenes embedded within a single web page,
and support for multiple instances of components of the same type.

## What's Next?

[blender]: https://www.blender.org/
[magicavoxel]: https://ephtracy.github.io/

We want to make it **easier to get started** with A-Frame. This includes a
refreshed homepage with new example scenes that act as starter kits. These
examples will be accompanied with free assets, guides, and workflow tutorials
on how to use A-Frame alongside tools such as [MagicaVoxel][magicavoxel] and
[Blender][blender].

We are also excited to improve the component discovery and consumption process
to have an easy place to find great community components. We'll also be
thinking about asset curation and discovery which should sound great if you've
ever had trouble finding free 3D models.

over the next several months.
