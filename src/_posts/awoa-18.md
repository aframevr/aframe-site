The Mozilla VR team met up together in London with contributors, [Don
McCurdy](https://twitter.com/donrmccurdy) and [DrawVR](https://drawvr.com), who
have been with A-Frame since the start. And
[@georational](https://twitter.com/georational) from down the street stopped by
to say hi as well. There's strong momentum heading into the second half of
2016; let's do special things to finish off The Year of VR!
