A-Frame's greatest strength is in enabling an ecosystem and the community of
people who come together to make developing WebVR a rewarding experience.

## Getting Started

- [Documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/) - Official documentation and guides. If you get
  stuck anywhere, let us know!
- [GitHub](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe) - A-Frame GitHub repository. Also check out
  other projects in the [`aframevr` GitHub organization](https://github.com/aframevr). Star
  the project if you like it!
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aframe) - The official place to
  ask questions and get technical support. Please first search for whether your
  question has already been answered on the [FAQ](/faq/) or [Stack
  Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aframe), and put effort

## Discord

There's an #aframe channel on the [Supermedium Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tGYjkYr).

## Slack

Historically the A-Frame Slack was the main channel for discussions.
You can still [join it](https://join.slack.com/t/aframevr/shared_invite/zt-f6rne3ly-ekVaBU~Xu~fsZHXr56jacQ), but you may not see
lots of discussion there now that the history is limited and lost after 90 days. Everyone is hanging out on Discord now.
